# Dapper-dotnet-6
Wrapper over dapper


WHY DAPPER?

1. Queries the database and maps to a return type.
2. Extensions built on top of ADO.Net, has asynchronous methods.
3. No CHange tracking involved and unlike EF we dont have to write sql queries that are directly executed against the DB.
4. Arguments to queries are passed as parameters so it is not susceptible to SQL Injection
